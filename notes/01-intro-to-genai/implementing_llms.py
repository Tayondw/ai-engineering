Implementing LLMs

To understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) operate, let's examine a simplified pseudocode example that outlines the tokenization and embedding process.

This process is fundamental to how LLMs interpret and generate text, and it draws parallels to various software development practices.

"""

# Tokenization Function
def tokenize(text):
    """
    The tokenize function is the starting point, where a given text is broken down into individual tokens.

    This process is like parsing in programming languages, where a string of code is divided into
    manageable components for analysis. Each token represents a basic unit of meaning, similar to
    how a parser identifies keywords, operators, and identifiers in code.
    """
    tokens = text.split(" ")
    return tokens

# Embeddings
def generate_embeddings(tokens):
    """
    Once tokenized, the next step involves converting these tokens into embeddings.

    Embeddings are numerical vectors that capture the semantic essence of each token, much like how data structures such as arrays or hashmaps organize and store data for efficient retrieval. This vectorization process allows LLMs to understand context and relationships between words, enabling more nuanced text generation.
    """
    embeddings = []
    for token in tokens:
        embedding = vectorize(token)
        embeddings.append(embedding)
    return embeddings


# Generate Text
def generate_text(embeddings):
    """
    Finally, the generate_text function uses these embeddings to predict and construct coherent text.

    This step is analogous to auto-completion features in Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), where the system suggests the next logical word or phrase based on context. Think "Smart Completions" for the IntelliJ IDEA and "IntelliSense" for Visual Studio. By leveraging probability-based models, LLMs can generate text that is contextually relevant and grammatically correct.
    """
    text = ""
    for embedding in embeddings:
        word = predict_next_word(embedding)
        text += word + " "
    return text.strip()
